This is a personal website that I would like to use as a Resume refrence. Some learning experiences personal, information, and interests of mine.


--- Css Features ---
A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon

Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop.

--- java scrip feature ---

Create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation (calculates something) and displays the result on your page or otherwise uses that value to do something on the site.
